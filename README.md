First project - game

My game is called 'Zombieland: The Journey Back,' and it is an RPG (role-playing game) & Adventure game. The game requires the player to make choices when presented with them, and each choice will have a different outcome. There are many variables to consider while playing this game, and the choices a player makes will determine if they finish the game (and win) or not.

The game provides the player with a short backstory:

In a zombie apocalypse world, a cure for zombie-ism has been found. The player is presented with the task of choosing a character to play, a zombie, with the goal of acquiring this cure. The player can choose between two characters to play, and each has different features, both good and bad. The gameplay will be slightly different depending on which character is chosen. The player must also collect a certain number of hidden items in order to finish and win the game. There is a progress bar that displays the character's life, and the player must maintain it above 0 or they will lose the game.

The technologies used in this game are as follows: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. A large part of the game is done in Javascript & JQuery, as navigation through the game requires some animation. HTML and CSS were used to provide the basic display of the game, while Javascript & JQuery were to enhance user experience and to provide game logic. HTML was also heavily used due to the large number of images and the gameplay's dependence on image mapping.

For this game, I started with HTML and CSS to first have a display of the game, and to visualize how it will play out. The Javascript and JQuery were used to animate the images for display purposes as well. The main logic used for this game is if/else statements. The game relies heavily on these due to its nature of branching out storylines and different potential events, which depend on the players' choices throughout the game.

As of right now, everything should be functioning correctly. I have not run into unsolved problems after several run-throughs of the game. However, I have not been able to gauge the level of difficulty. It may be too difficult to play due to the restricted time given. This can be solved by changing the setTimeOut function so that the player can have more time to complete the game.
