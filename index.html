        <p class="zombie-desc">This zombie used to be a regular student before she got bit. She used to love eating delicious food, but all she wants now is some human brains to eat. Help her get back to the lab to change her back! Her strength is average, but her life bar decreases slower than most zombies.</p>

      <h2>The Situation:</h2>
      <p id="game-directions">These zombies need your help! They have been bitten and turned into  zombies against their will, but are trying to make their way to the Science Lab to de-zombify themselves. However, their brains are a bit fuzzy from all the zombie toxins, not to mention the constant hunger for human brains. We need you to guide a zombie to the lab and get them back to their original human forms.
      <br>
      <br>
      But... just a word of warning. These zombies will die if they do not get proper feeding every so often. So if you run into humans... you do what you gotta do. Watch out for the life bar! If it gets to zero, it's over.
      <br>
      <br>
      You may also pick up objects along the way to help you on your quest. But beware, some objects are not as helpful as you think...
      <br>
      <br>
      Good luck!

        <p class="zombie-desc">This guy used to be an actor before he got bit. Now his only joy in "life" is slurping fresh brains out of human heads. Help him get his non-brain-slurping-life back by taking him to the lab. His strength is above average, but his life bar decreases a bit faster and needs feeding more often.</p>

    <h2>Your Goal:</h2>
    <p id="game-goals">Now that you've chosen and named your zombie, your goal is to get <span class="name">zombie</span> to the Science Lab ALIVE (as alive as can be anyway). Make sure to keep <span class="name">zombie</span> well-fed... if you know what I mean. And be sure to judge a situation correctly, as it could mean life or death (for the most part).</p>
    <p>The Science Lab is 15 blocks straight down this street from where you are. However, you are encouraged to explore the streets to the right and left, just to see if there are any useful objects to pick up or... brains to munch on. Choose your path by clicking the corresponding arrows (straight, left, or right).</p>
