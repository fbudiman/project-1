        <p class="zombie-desc">This gal used to be a regular student before she got bit. She used to love eating all kinds of food, but all she wants now is some human brains to eat. Her strength is below average - so be extra careful around humans - but her life bar decreases slower than most zombies.</p>

      <h2>The Situation:</h2>
      <p id="game-directions">A cure to zombie-ism has been found! Lucky for you, the zombie-curing-Science-Lab is located only several miles away from where you are. However, being a zombie is not so easy, having to deal with that constant hunger for human brains and whatnot. You should try to make it to that lab to turn back into a human, but... you definitely can't make it on an empty stomach.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you don't feed yourself every so often, you WILL die (deader than you already are). Don't let that happen - watch out for the life bar! If it hits zero, it's over. So that means if you run into some humans... you do what you gotta do.
      <br>
      <br>
      You may also pick up objects along the way to help you on your quest. But some objects are not as helpful as you think...
      <br>
      <br>
      Good luck!

        <p class="zombie-desc">This guy used to be an actor before he got bit. Now his only joy in "life" is slurping fresh brains out of human heads. His strength is above average, but his life bar decreases a bit faster and needs feeding more often.</p>

    <h2>Your Goal:</h2>
    <p id="game-goals">Now that you've chosen and named your zombie, your goal is to get <span class="name">zombie</span> to the Science Lab ALIVE (as alive as can be anyway). Make sure to keep <span class="name">zombie</span> well-fed... do whatever it takes. And be sure to judge a situation wisely, as it could mean life or death (for the most part).</p>
    <p>The Science Lab is 15 blocks straight down this street from where you are. However, you are encouraged to explore the streets to the right and left, just to see if there are any useful objects to pick up or... brains to munch on. Choose your path by clicking the corresponding arrows (straight, left, or right).</p>
